# TeX-g

A code golfing TeX dialect.

This is WIP software, don't expect anything to work tomorrow or in a couple of
minutes, even if it used to work in the last minute.

## TODO:

Much. Like almost everything. Only some shorthands for definitions and a simple
for-loop for csv-lists are implemented.

Oh, and the best part: there is no documentation yet.
